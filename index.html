                                I know that I should put a lot of effort to became one, but it's more exciting, isn't it?
                                 And I love challanges, because they can give you the possibility to experience this feeling,
                                  when you begin to understand the bigger picture, what's purpose of some things,
                                   how it works together etc. I love that feeling.
                               And because of that my current goal to find a team that can help me to grow into specialist.

                                The day I was born. I think it's important enough day from my life. 
                                It's also very important day for me because when I was born I immediately met my first true friend,
                                my twin brother. If we talk form perspective of our parents, it was a really big surprise for them,
                                because they didn't expect to became parents of twins. Considering the above,

                                My school period. Of course during such a long period a lot of stuff happened.
                                But for me the most important is that I learned to communicate with other people,
                                make friends, be a good person and be passion for knowledge. I've never had a feeling
                                that I special in some way, but for some reason it always was easy for me and my brother
                                to make friends with people, even if they have cardinally different interests, and school
                                made me understand this.

                                My university period. During this period of my life I understood how to solve problems with people,
                                how it's important to do things in time and especially that I mustn't have high expectations for anything.
                                This period ended with my decision to focus on more important things for me, so I dropped out on second year
                                of magistracy.

                                This day and all following days of course affected me, like any Ukrainian. Considering that 
                                I had been interested in idea of becoming developer before, I decided that I should join to community
                                of developers, which is probably one of the most helpful communities for our country in this time.
                                So from the very beginning of war I started to learn programming to become developer no matter what
                                and as fast as it possibly. And as soon as I started searching for a job, I decided that I shouldn't
                                spend my time on the other things, and dropped out from university.

                                    I love Ukrainian language very much, because it's really fascinating and rich. More than half words
                                    in Ukrainian language are multivalued. For example, do you know which Ukrainian word can describe

                                    I used to go to art school when I was in junior school. I loved to paint, so it was really exciting.
                                    But after first year in this school had passed I suddenly started to hate it within the painting in general,
                                    so I think that I had known what is mentally burnout before it become mainstream &#129396;

                                    During last year 8 of my friends started to learn programming, but all of them had given up learning because
                                    it's not interesting enough for them, so now if I hear “Awful eight” I can't think of Tarantino's film anymore &#127921;
